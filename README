Javascript-Slideshow
====================

Mediawiki Javascript Slideshow

Installation:
Add this to LocalSettings.php
require_once('$IP/extensions/JavascriptSlideshow/JavascriptSlideshow.php');

From version 1.1 HTML5 output needs to be enabled in mediawiki. It
is enabled by default, so you shouldn't need to do anything, as
long as $wgHtml5 isn't set to false in your LocalSettings.php.
